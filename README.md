# tycho.pizza

Here is the source code for my web page, [tycho.pizza](http://tycho.pizza).


It used to serve as an example of how to use the blog engine
[haggis](https://github.com/tych0/haggis), until I basically stopped blogging.
As a result, I've committed the generated files (gasp!) and updated the default
page to be simple, instead of the previous blog index. However, given that the
old pages are committed here, old links to old blog posts should still work
(yay).

`templates/` contains the five templates that haggis requires to generate your
site. These particular templates are twitter bootstrap based.

`src/` is the page source.
