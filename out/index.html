        <p> Hello. I am Tycho! You are probably here because you want to know
            more about me:

            <ul>
                <li> I am a member of some important social networks:
                     <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13638050">Strava</a>,
                     <a href="https://freenode.net">freenode (tych0)</a>, and
                     <a href="https://github.com/tych0">Github</a>. </li>

                <li> Professionally, I have been advancing open source
                     software since 2013 working on the LX{C,D} team, the Docker
                     security team, and a Linux platform team at Cisco. During
                     this time, I have focused on
                     upstreaming Linux kernel security and other features,
                     design and implementation of various features of container engines
                     and image formats, and live migration of Linux containers. </li>

                <li> I have been working on <a href="http://qtile.org">Qtile</a>
                     since I was a graduate student looking to avoid Real Work in
                     2009. </li>

                <li> There was <a href="/archives/index.html">previously a blog</a>
                     at this URL, but I switched to this page because I hadn't
                     updated it for years. </li>

                <li> You can contact me by e-mailing tycho @ this domain. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
