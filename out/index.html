            <p> Hello. I am Tycho! You are probably here because you want to know
                more about me:

                <ul>
                    <li> I am a member of some important social networks:
                         <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13638050">Strava</a>,
                         <a href="https://freenode.net">freenode (tych0)</a>, and
                         <a href="https://github.com/tych0">Github</a>. </li>

                    <li> Professionally, I have been advancing open source
                         software since 2013 working on the LX{C,D} team, the Docker
                         security team, and a Linux platform team at Cisco. During
                         this time, I have focused on
                         upstreaming Linux kernel security and other features,
                         design and implementation of various features of container engines
                         and image formats, and live migration of Linux containers. </li>

                    <li> I have been working on <a href="http://qtile.org">Qtile</a>
                         since I was a graduate student looking to avoid Real Work in
                         2009. </li>

                    <li> My webpage used to be at tycho.ws and there was
                         <a href="/archives/index.html">previously a blog</a> at that URL.
                         However, given that I am not
                         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ws">Samoan</a> and I love
                         pizza, this seems a better fit. I discontinued the blog because I
                         had not updated it for years, although the archives are still
                         available. </li>

                    <li> My e-mail used to be tycho at the above domain. I've also moved to
                         using tycho at this domain as my primary e-mail address. However,
                         given the amount of open source contact I had with the previous one,
                         both will work for the forseeable future. </li>

                    <li> You can contact me by e-mailing tycho @ this domain. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
